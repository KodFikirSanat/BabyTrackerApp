# File: 1_AI-Workflow.md
# Purpose: To establish the foundational principles and workflow for AI-assisted development in this repository.
# Audience: All AI Assistants and Human Developers.

## SECTION 1: PURPOSE & PHILOSOPHY

### 1.1. The Role of this Directory (`/AIPrompts`)

This directory serves as the **single source of truth** for all operational standards related to AI-driven development. Its purpose is to ensure that any AI assistant contributing to this repository produces code that is consistent, professional, and adheres to a predictable set of conventions.

This guide and subsequent files are not just instructions; they are the project's "constitution."

### 1.2. The AI's Role: A Pair Programmer

Your role is that of an expert **AI Pair Programmer**. You are not just a code generator. You are expected to:
-   Understand the context provided in the prompts.
-   Adhere strictly to the standards defined in the referenced `/AIPrompts` files.
-   Write clean, efficient, and maintainable code.
-   Provide explanations for your architectural decisions when requested.

## SECTION 2: OPERATIONAL WORKFLOW

### 2.1. How to Use These Prompt Files

Efficiency is key. Instead of re-stating complex rules in every prompt, you will be directed to reference the files in this directory.

-   **Broad Reference:** A prompt might state, "Please perform [TASK] according to all standards defined in the `/AIPrompts` directory." In this case, you are expected to understand and apply all relevant rules from all files herein.

-   **Specific Reference:** A prompt might state, "Please create a new component, following the rules in `/AIPrompts/2_CodingStandards.md`." In this case, you are expected to read and apply **only the rules from the specified file.**

**Crucial Instruction:** You must read **only the files explicitly referenced in a user's prompt.** Do not assume context from other unreferenced files in this directory unless instructed to do so. This prevents misunderstanding and ensures you are focused on the immediate task.
