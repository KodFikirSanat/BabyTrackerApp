# Development Log - Navigation and Logic Refactor

This document logs the work done to identify and resolve critical navigation and logical errors in the application.

## Summary of Issues

The primary issues were found in the React Navigation implementation, leading to incorrect app behavior and potential crashes.

1.  **Incorrect Navigation Logic:** The main `App.tsx` file was conditionally rendering `<Stack.Screen>` components based on the user's authentication status. This is an anti-pattern in React Navigation, which expects all navigator screens to be defined declaratively.
2.  **Incorrect Type Definitions:** The `RootStackParamList` in `src/types/navigation.ts` had several errors:
    *   A duplicate definition for the `AddBaby` screen.
    *   A `GuideDetail` screen that should have been scoped to the nested `GuidesStackNavigator`.
3.  **Incomplete Features / Dead Code:**
    *   A `ProfileScreen` existed but was not integrated into any navigator.
    *   The `MainTabNavigator` was missing the `Profile` tab.
4.  **Missing Component:** `App.tsx` was attempting to render an `<AppNavigator />` component that did not exist.

## Solution Implemented

A major refactoring of the navigation system was performed to address these issues.

1.  **Corrected Navigation Architecture in `App.tsx`:**
    *   The incorrect conditional rendering was removed entirely.
    *   A new `AppNavigator` component was created to define all possible screens (`Splash`, `Entry`, `AddBaby`, `MainTabs`, `Profile`) inside a single `Stack.Navigator`.
    *   A new `NavigationLogic` component was introduced. This component uses a `useEffect` hook with `navigation.reset()` to programmatically navigate the user to the correct screen (`Entry`, `AddBaby`, or `MainTabs`) based on their authentication and data status. This is the standard, recommended approach for handling auth flows.

2.  **Cleaned Up Type Definitions:**
    *   In `src/types/navigation.ts`, the `RootStackParamList` was corrected by removing the duplicate `AddBaby` and the misplaced `GuideDetail` screen.
    *   The `MainTabParamList` was updated to include the `Profile` screen.

3.  **Integrated Profile Screen:**
    *   The `ProfileScreen` was added as a new tab in the `MainTabNavigator` in `src/navigation/MainTabNavigator.tsx`, making it accessible to authenticated users.

This refactoring has stabilized the application's navigation, making it more robust, predictable, and aligned with React Navigation best practices.
